# Netflix Menu Transition

This project is an implementation of Netflix's Navigation Menu transition.

It has been developed using

- HTML,
- CSS,and
- JavaScript

It has been built using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNOscFG0PYo) by Florin Pop.

However, minor changes have been made to make the code more self-documenting.

The site is currently deployed on GitHub pages and can be accessed [here](https://tankris.github.io/Netflix-Menu-Transition/).
