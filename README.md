# Netflix Menu Transition

This project is an implementation of Netflix's Navigation Menu transition

This project has been developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The site has been built using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNOscFG0PYo) by Florin Pop

However minor changes have been made to make the code more self-documenting

The project is deployed on GitHub pages and can be accessed [here](https://tankris.github.io/Netflix-Menu-Transition/)
